h2. What?

This is an unobtrusive notifier for Colloquy.

It puts an icon on your menubar that changes color when you have been mentioned or received a private message.

h2. Why?

Growl and/or the bouncing dock icon were too distracting for me.

h2. How?

To install:

1. Install PyObjC: @sudo easy_install pyobjc@
2. Install plugin: @mv MenuBar.py ~/Libarary/Application\ Support/Colloquy/PlugIns/@ 

I know nothing about PyObjC. The code is mostly borrowed from the MenuBar Status plugin here: http://colloquy.info/extras/details.php?file=45
